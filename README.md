# Task 5 – Titanic EDA (Data Analyst Internship)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the famous **Titanic Dataset** from Kaggle.  
The goal is to extract insights about factors influencing passenger survival using Python and data visualization techniques.

## 🧠 Objective
To perform visual and statistical exploration to find meaningful patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the Titanic dataset.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning & manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization  
- **Seaborn** – Advanced statistical plots  
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook** – Development environment  

## 📂 Files in this Repository
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `Task5_Titanic_EDA.ipynb` | Jupyter/Colab notebook containing code and visualizations |
| `Task5_Titanic_EDA.pdf` | Final PDF report summarizing findings |
| `train.csv` | Dataset used (downloaded from kaggle Titanic Dataset) |
| `images/` *(optional)* | Saved plot screenshots used in the report |
|`Jupyter/ colab notebook` Link - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YVk1ap_ZU_IQr2-uCjuazgNBg1QX4yRy?usp=sharing
## 🔍 Key Insights
- Women and children had higher survival rates.  
- First-class passengers had the highest chance of survival.  
- Higher fare → greater survival probability.  
- Strong correlations found between **Sex**, **Pclass**, and **Survival**.

## 🚀 How to Run the Notebook
1. Open `Task5_Titanic_EDA.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).  
2. Upload `train.csv` when prompted.  
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visuals.  
4. Export the notebook as PDF for reporting.

## 📈 Outcome
Gained practical experience in **EDA**, data visualization, and understanding of key survival factors from Titanic data.
